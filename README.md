to use Moment.js and other third party APIs.

* Display the currnt day at the top of the calendar
* Present timeblocks for standard busines hours
* Color code timeblocks to indicate wheater it is in the past, present, or future
* Allow user to enter an event

* use local storage to save timeblock event and if page is refresehd the saved entry is still present

Lessons applied:

* Implemented local storage to have entry be saved after refresehd
* In HTML file, implemented text area and button for timeblocks
